"""
ðŸ’¬ CONVERSATION HANDLER - Multi-turn Conversation Management
===========================================================

Handles multi-turn conversations with homeowners for project clarification.
Manages conversation state, context preservation, and intelligent follow-up
questions to gather complete project requirements.

MCP Integration:
- Uses redis for conversation state storage and event coordination
- Stores conversation logs in supabase for analysis
- Leverages context7 for conversational AI best practices

Business Rules:
- Maintain conversation context across multiple messages
- Ask intelligent follow-up questions for missing information
- Handle conversation flow based on project type
- Cost control: <$0.03 per conversation turn
- Security: Block all contact information attempts
