## CURRENT SESSION FINDINGS
‚úÖ Found core/events/ COMPLETELY BUILT (schemas.py, coordinator.py)
‚úÖ Found core/memory/ COMPLETELY BUILT (all 4 files)
‚úÖ Found core/security/ 75% BUILT (missing cost_breaker.py, audit_logger.py)
‚úÖ Found core/base/ 33% BUILT (missing event_mixin.py, health_monitor.py)
‚úÖ Found agents/homeowner_intake/ STARTED (intake_agent.py complete)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (CRITICAL PATH)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete core/security/ system (BUSINESS MODEL CRITICAL)
   - Build cost_breaker.py (expense protection)
   - Build audit_logger.py (compliance logging)
2. Complete core/base/ shared patterns
   - Build event_mixin.py (event handling patterns)
   - Build health_monitor.py (agent health tracking)
3. Complete agents/homeowner_intake/ domain
   - Build nlp_processor.py, data_extractor.py, conversation_handler.py, intake_schemas.py
4. Begin remaining agent domains (agents/project_scope/, etc.)

## CRITICAL NOTES
- ‚úÖ All code uses proper MCP integration patterns
- ‚úÖ Cost controls and circuit breakers embedded
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail logging implemented
- ‚úÖ Event-driven coordination established
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact protection is business model critical - must be 100% effective
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing critical cost_breaker.py and audit_logger.py files

## ARCHITECTURE READY STATUS
- ‚úÖ Redis Streams coordination infrastructure
- ‚úÖ MCP tool integration patterns
- ‚úÖ Event publishing and consumption
- ‚úÖ 3-tier memory system (Redis + Supabase + Event Store)
- üöß Contact protection (business model protection) - 75% complete
- üöß Agent base classes and patterns - 33% complete

## REPOSITORY QUALITY
- **File Structure:** Following exact build plan specifications
- **MCP Integration:** All external calls via MCP tools
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive inline documentation  
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure and recovery patterns
- **Business Logic:** Contact protection embedded throughout
